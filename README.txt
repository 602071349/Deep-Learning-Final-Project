Analysis of Different Transfer Learning Approaches on Natural Scenes Classification

In this project, our code is written as a Jupyter notebook: code.ipynb. Please install Jupyter notebook by following the tutorial:
https://jupyter.org/install

Our code also uses the following Python libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, numpy, sklearn. Please install those packages before running the code.

Our code is dividied into the following sections:
1. Loading Data
2. Visualizing the Sample Images
3. Data Exploration
4. Transfer Learning Appraoches for Different Architectures
5. Ensemble Model

Sample Command for Running the Code:
jupyter notebook code.ipynb

The dataset we used is the Intel Natural Scene Classification dataset available at:
